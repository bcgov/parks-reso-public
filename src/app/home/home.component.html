          The BC Parks Day Use Pilot Project for the 2021 winter season successfully came to an end on March 31, 2021.   Please check back in the future for updates on the BC Parks Day Use Pass Pilot.

          Some of our most popular parks regularly experience high visitor volumes, resulting in crowded trails and facilities, packed parking lots, impacts to park environments and wildlife, local community concerns, and safety issues. The Day-Use Pass Pilot Program was implemented to address these issues during peak periods at select parks.
