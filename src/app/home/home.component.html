                        <br><br>
                        When visiting the great outdoors make sure to:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do your research and pack your essentials. Nature is unpredictable, so it’s good to be prepared for anything.</li>
                            <li>Make a trip plan and tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back.</li>
                            <li>Pack out all garbage, recyclables, and organics. Organic matter can attract wildlife.</li>
                        </ul>
